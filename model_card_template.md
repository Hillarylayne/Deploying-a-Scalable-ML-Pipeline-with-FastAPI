## Model Details
This model is a supervised machine learning classifier trained to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year based on demographic and employment-related features from U.S. Census data. The model is implemented using a Random Forest classifier from the scikit-learn library.

## Intended Use
The intended use of this model is to demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a RESTful API. This model is designed for educational purposes only and should not be used to make real-world financial, employment, or policy decisions.

## Training Data
The training data consists of the UCI Census Income dataset (also known as the Adult dataset). It contains demographic and employment information such as age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, race, sex, and hours worked per week. The dataset includes 32,561 records with a binary target variable indicating whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year.

## Evaluation Data
The dataset was split into training and test sets using an 80/20 split with stratification based on the income label. The test dataset was used to evaluate overall model performance as well as performance on slices of categorical features.

## Metrics
The model was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.  
The model achieved the following performance on the test dataset:

- Precision: **0.7379**
- Recall: **0.6339**
- F1-score: **0.6820**

Performance was also evaluated across slices of categorical features such as workclass, education, and sex in order to identify potential differences in model behavior across subgroups.

## Ethical Considerations
This model is trained on historical census data and may reflect existing social and economic biases present in the dataset. Features such as race and sex may lead to disparities in predictions across different demographic groups. Predictions generated by this model should be interpreted with caution, and fairness considerations should be addressed before any deployment in real-world decision-making contexts.

## Caveats and Recommendations
This model is intended solely for instructional use and is not suitable for production deployment. It should not be used to determine an individual’s income level or eligibility for employment, benefits, or financial products. Future work could include hyperparameter tuning, evaluation using fairness metrics, and the use of bias mitigation techniques to improve equitable performance across demographic groups.
